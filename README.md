The face recognition is a technique to identify or verify the face from the digital images or video frame. A human can quickly identify the faces without much effort. It is an effortless task for us, but it is a difficult task for a computer. There are various complexities, such as low resolution, occlusion, illumination variations, etc. These factors highly affect the accuracy of the computer to recognize the face more effectively. First, it is necessary to understand the difference between face detection and face recognition.

Face Detection: The face detection is generally considered as finding the faces (location and size) in an image and probably extract them to be used by the face detection algorithm.

Face Recognition: The face recognition algorithm is used in finding features that are uniquely described in the image. The facial image is already extracted, cropped, resized, and usually converted in the grayscale.
